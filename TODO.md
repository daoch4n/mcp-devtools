## User Story 1: Worktree Snapshots
**As a** developer using `ai_edit`  
**I want** to see only the changes made by the current tool execution  
**So that** I can focus on relevant modifications without unrelated changes  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Automatically create a worktree snapshot before each `ai_edit` execution  
- Generate diff showing only changes made during the current operation  
- Preserve snapshot for 24 hours for debugging purposes  

## User Story 2: Parallel Execution Support  
**As a** developer working on multiple features  
**I want** to run multiple `ai_edit` operations concurrently  
**So that** I can optimize my development workflow  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Implement isolated workspaces for concurrent operations  
- Add session IDs to track parallel executions  
- Prevent file conflicts through automatic locking  
- Show parallel operation status in dashboard  

## User Story 3: Automatic Worktree Management  
**As a** developer  
**I want** automatic Git worktree creation for each operation  
**So that** I have a clean environment for each task  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Create temporary worktrees for each `ai_edit` execution  
- Automatically clean up worktrees after successful operations  
- Preserve worktrees for failed operations for debugging  

## User Story 4: Change Context Awareness  
**As a** code reviewer  
**I want** to see the exact context of changes  
**So that** I understand how modifications fit into existing code  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Show 3 lines of context before/after each change  
- Highlight changed lines in diff view  
- Provide file navigation in change preview  

## User Story 5: Atomic Operations  
**As a** developer  
**I want** each `ai_edit` operation to be atomic  
**So that** I can safely interrupt or retry operations  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Implement transactional file modifications  
- Automatic rollback on failure  
- Retry mechanism for interrupted operations  

## User Story 6: Performance Metrics  
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** performance tracking for `ai_edit` operations  
**So that** I can optimize resource allocation  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Track execution time per operation  
- Monitor resource usage (CPU/memory)  
- Generate performance reports  
- Alert on abnormal patterns
