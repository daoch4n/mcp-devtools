# Implement Parallel Execution Support for ai_edit

## Objective
Add support for parallel execution of `ai_edit` operations by using isolated workspaces and session tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each `ai_edit` operation runs in an isolated workspace
- Session IDs are used to track parallel executions
- Separate `.aider.chat.history.md` files for each session
- Support for session resume functionality
- Automatic session ID generation
- Session status tracking in tool output

## Files to Modify
- mcp_devtools/server.py
- test_server.py (for new test cases)

## Implementation Notes
1. Use a session ID to track each execution
2. Create isolated workspaces for concurrent operations
3. Maintain separate chat history files per session
4. Add session management commands (list, status, resume)
5. Ensure thread safety for parallel operations

## Additional Context
This is User Story 2 from TODO.md. We need to ensure this works alongside the existing worktree snapshots feature.
For the import error:
- Ensure mypy can find the snapshot_utils module by adding an `__init__.py` file (already done) and verifying the import path

For the redefinition:
- We have two variables named `pre_existing_untracked_files` in the same function. Rename the second one to `pre_existing_untracked_files_set`.

## Additional Context
We already added an empty `__init__.py` and renamed the second variable, but mypy still reports errors. Need to ensure the import is correctly resolved.
