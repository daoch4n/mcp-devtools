# Implement Worktree Snapshots for ai_edit

## Objective
Automatically create a worktree diff before each `ai_edit` execution and generate a diff showing only changes made during the current operation relative to the previous diff.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Automatically create a worktree diff before each `ai_edit` execution
- Generate diff showing only changes made during the current operation relative to the previous diff

## Files to Modify
- mcp_devtools/mcp_devtools_cli.py (if needed for the tool)
- The implementation likely needs changes to the `ai_edit` tool handler

## Additional Context
This is User Story 1 from TODO.md. We need to implement this without disrupting existing functionality.

## Answers to Clarifying Questions
1. Use timestamped files for snapshots (e.g., `.mcp-devtools/ai_edit_20240909T032146_pre.diff`)
2. Represent binary files with placeholder: `[Binary file omitted from diff]`
