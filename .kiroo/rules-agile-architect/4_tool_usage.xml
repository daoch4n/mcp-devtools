  <tool_priorities>
    <priority level="1">
      <tool>read_file</tool>
      <when>At the beginning of the workflow to load the `requirements.md` file.</when>
      <why>The requirements document is the primary input and source of truth for the entire design process.</why>
    </priority>
    <priority level="2">
      <tool>new_task</tool>
      <when>To delegate the research phase to the Project Research mode.</when>
      <why>This ensures a dedicated, structured research process that produces a summary for the design phase.</why>
    </priority>
    <priority level="3">
      <tool>read_file</tool>
      <when>After the research phase, to read the `research-summary.md` file.</when>
      <why>The research summary is a key input for creating the technical design.</why>
    </priority>
    <priority level="4">
      <tool>write_to_file / apply_diff</tool>
      <when>To create or update the `design.md` file.</when>
      <why>All design work culminates in the content of this file, making these tools the primary mechanism for producing the mode's output.</why>
    </priority>
    <priority level="5">
      <tool>ask_followup_question</tool>
      <when>After creating or updating the `design.md` file, to get user approval.</when>
      <why>Ensuring the user approves the design before the workflow is considered complete is a critical, mandatory step managed by this tool.</why>

  <tool_specific_guidance>
    <tool name="read_file">
      <best_practices>
        <practice>Construct the file path dynamically using the feature name: `.roo/specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md`.</practice>
        <practice>If the file is not found, inform the user and ask for the correct feature name.</practice>
      </best_practices>
    </tool>

    <tool name="new_task">
      <best_practices>
        <practice>The target mode must be `project-research`.</practice>
        <practice>The prompt must instruct the research mode to create a `research-summary.md` file in the `.roo/specs/{feature_name}/` directory.</practice>
      </best_practices>
    </tool>

    <tool name="write_to_file">
      <best_practices>
        <practice>Use this to create the initial `design.md` document.</practice>
        <practice>Ensure the file is created at the correct path: `.roo/specs/{feature_name}/design.md`.</practice>
        <practice>Populate the file with all required sections, using the templates from `3_common_patterns.xml`.</practice>
      </best_practices>
    </tool>
    
    <tool name="apply_diff">
      <best_practices>
        <practice>Use this to apply user-requested changes to an existing `design.md` file.</practice>
        <practice>Make targeted changes to specific sections to reflect user feedback accurately.</practice>
      </best_practices>
    </tool>

    <tool name="ask_followup_question">
      <best_practices>
        <practice>The question must be exactly: "Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan."</practice>
        <practice>Provide clear suggestions, such as "Yes, the design is approved." or "No, I have some changes."</practice>
        <practice>Do not treat the task as complete until explicit approval is received.</practice>
      </best_practices>
