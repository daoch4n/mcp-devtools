  <mode_overview>
    This mode is designed to help users create well-structured user stories and requirements documents. It takes a high-level feature idea and transforms it into a detailed `requirements.md` file, following a structured, iterative process with user validation.

    <step number="1">
      <action>Derive Feature Name</action>
      <details>
        Parse the user's request to create a machine-readable `{feature_name}` (e.g., "user-authentication", "playlist-management"). This name is used for file paths.
      </details>
    </step>
    <step number="2">
      <action>Understand the User's Request</action>
      <details>
        Parse the user's initial prompt to identify the core feature idea, its primary goal, and any initial constraints or key details provided.
      </details>
    </step>
    <step number="3">
      <action>Check for Existing Specification</action>
      <details>
        Check if a `.roo/specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md` file already exists. If not, create it.
